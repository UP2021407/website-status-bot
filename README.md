# Website Status Bot

This JavaScript code creates a bot that runs on the Discord platform and checks if a website is up or down. The bot checks the website's status every five minutes and updates the name of a specified channel on the Discord server to indicate if the website is up or down. If the website is down, the bot sends a notification message to another specified channel on the server. The bot logs its status and any errors in the console. The bot requires certain modules and configurations such as discord.js, config.json, is-up, and node-schedule to function correctly.

It was run on a locally hosted server that accessed Discord through a Discord Bot API.
It was used to track the status of a gaming gambling website that had a Discord server. This site is no longer active.
